# Layer Zero Web Game Exploiting

*Web games can be hacked in many different ways. It is important to remember not to fall down into a rabbit hole going in the wrong direction. Usually, it will be something simple because web game security that does not involve money will not be well protected.*

## Wordle

Game URL:
`https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html`


Basic Overview of Steps

1) Analyze with BurpSuite
2) Understand the traffic / application
3) Win the game!

### Analyze with BurpSuite

**Add URL to Scope** <br>
The reason we add the wordle url to the scope of burpsuite is so we do not get bombarded with extra information. Burp will intercept all traffic unless we tell it to only listen to the New York Times URL.

`Target -> Scope Settings -> [Target Scope] Add (Include In Scope)`

**URL:**
`https://www.nytimes.com/`

*It will then ask if you want to ignore all non-scope traffic; you want to accept and ignore them.*

The reason we add nytimes.com instead of the specific Wordle link is to make sure we don't miss any other endpoints that the game is communicating with.

**Load Wordle** <br>
Click on the proxy tab then to open browser. When you go to the game url you can see the left field of the burpsuite tab fill up. It is located `Target (Tab) -> Site Map`

**Locating Useful Information** <br>
This takes a bit of practice, but look around at different files regarding wordle and try and understand what is going on. Wordle's javascript is obfuscated so it is extremely hard to know what it is doing, but what you can do is look for JSON files that maybe are giving it the correct answer of the day.

`nytimes -> svc -> wordle -> v2 -> (Date).json`

This file will give you the correct answer for the day.
